Supporting: bokeh circles, sun rays, diagonal sheen sweeps. Keep the specific slice of nature (underwater, meadow, droplets) flexible. Use layered radial/linear gradients for the sky and gloss caps, rgba white overlays for sheen, and generous rounded panels. Do not drift into Y2K; the decisive difference is nature — if chrome, techno type, or cyber grids replace the skies and grass, you've crossed over.

Use chunky grotesk or hand-lettered headings, plain body text, and no gradients, shadows, or photorealism. Buttons and cards should feel like separate ink passes — flat color fields with the grain texture, 2px solid black outlines optional. Do not drift into Memphis; the decisive difference is that Risograph is print-texture-first (grain, misregistration, spot overprint) while Memphis is pattern-first (squiggles, zigzags, geometric confetti). Preserve text contrast: black ink on the spot colors usually passes; thin type over textured fills can fail, so keep labels large and on solid panels.",

Keep the specific iconography and exact angle flexible, but keep the diagonal energy and propaganda density.

In the 2010s the sensibility migrated into production UI in playful indie apps and landing pages, and tools like Excalidraw (late 2010s onward) made hand-drawn diagrams a mainstream open-source convention.

Set all labels in uppercase sans-serif with 0.06–0.12em letter-spacing and a medium weight; body text should stay minimal. Space blocks with generous black gaps (8–16px) so the colored shapes float on the canvas. Do not add scanlines, phosphor glow, terminal cursors, 3D bevels, or glass blur — those push the design toward Terminal Hacker or Aqua. For interactivity, states can invert text/background color or add a thin inner border; do not animate width/height on the lozenges. Maintain 4.5:1 contrast between the dark canvas and text, and ensure uppercase labels do not become unreadable at small sizes."
